# Next Steps

- Unit Circle is in -pi to pi, function graph is 0 - 2pi
    + choose and reconcile 
    + OR make a function that does a conversion 

- Refactor fn graph components into discrete functions like unit circle

- Re-use unit circle functions in fn graph (drawLine), pass in context as parameter 

- Plot tan, cot, sec & cos
    + need a way to cap max values, deal with Infinites
